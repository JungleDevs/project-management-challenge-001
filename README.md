  ## Description
  **Challenge goal**: The goal of this challenge is to give you the ability of investigating the design of an existing product and creating a list of tasks for your development team. You should create tasks for a Backend and a Frontend developer, identify dependency between multiple tasks and create a development roadmap.
  
  **Target level**: This is an entry level course, no prior knowledge of project management tools/methodologies is needed.
  
  **Final accomplishment**: By the end of this challenge, you will have created a development roadmap of several features for a digital product, including a timeline for an expected release date.

  ## Additional Information
  ### Context
  It's 2011 and the tech area is facing a boom of new digital tools to help improve collaboration, team work and drive better results for companies. You've recently joined a startup that is willing to build the next great tool for task management called Trello. They did a design sprint, interviewed potential users, created the mockups and validated the whole product. Everyone at the company feels they're ready to kick-off development ãƒ¼ and that's why they hired you! They want you to break the product down into epics, tasks and sub-tasks (if needed) and come up with a release timeline for their first launch.

  ### Let's keep it simple
  You don't need to consider all the different features of Trello, let's focus on the core feature: task management. 
  Please ignore plug-ins and add-ons for now. You should focus on:
  * Creating / managing a board (create columns, change background, add users, etc);
  * Creating / managing cards (assignee, description, checklists, etc).
  
  ## Acceptance criteria
  * Based on the design, create a list of the major flows and features;
  * Create a list of features and break them down into small stories (make it clear if a task is for the Backend or Frontend developers);
  * Define the dependency between the tasks and sort them based on that;
  * Create a roadmap for the initial release based on the core features (you can pick any tool for that) to have a sense of when each major feature is gonna be delivered; 
  * Create a Trello board (inception ðŸ˜…) or use any other tool you want to create the tasks. Populate each story with the following information, in a way that makes it clear to the devs (create sub-tasks as you wish):
    * Title
    * Description
    * Component
    * Attachments (images, videos, explanation files) - when applicable
    * Number of [story points](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation) - you can make assumptions here!
  * Organize the sprints in columns adding each card to the relevant sprint.
